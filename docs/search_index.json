[["index.html", "Great Again, When? Preface", " Great Again, When? in1fellswoop 2022-11-16 Preface My goal for this project, at the surface, is simple. I am evaluating the phrase ‘Make America Great Again’, but more specifically, what the statment presupposes: there was a time, before the present, where America was great. With this in mind, To achieve this, I must do the following: 1. First, identify what ‘greatness’ is and what what constitutes a great country 2. Second, determine the time period for which America (as it’s conceptualized today) became America 3. Third, scan through the time period outlined in step 2, to identify when America could meet the definition of a ‘great’ country as defined in step 1 I acknowledge that for some, steps 1, 2, and even 3, may seem unnecessary. For 1 and 2, it may seem like silly questions, and for step 3 some may have already made up their minds – therefore seeing this entire project as unnecessary. However, I would disagree. Parsing this phrase, and the history that supports or denies it will be a very enlightening journey. With that being said, history can be dense, and that’s because there’s a lot of it. However, I will do my best to make the material as accessible, approachable, and interesting for those who stumble upon it.
